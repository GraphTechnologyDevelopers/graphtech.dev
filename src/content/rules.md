# Community Rules

The full rulebook now lives on X. Read and share the canonical thread:

- [Pinned Rules Thread](https://x.com/bronzeagecto/status/1977502404041199995)

Key reminders for quick reference:

1. **On-topic, code-first.** Graph databases, knowledge graphs, GNNs, modeling, queries, performance.
2. **Show your work.** Include snippets, diagrams, or repro datasets.
3. **Tag once.** Choose the most relevant bracket tag for your post.
4. **Signal > promotion.** Benchmarks, design notes, or real findings accompany self-promo.
5. **Respect the crew.** Critique ideas, not people.

Weekly Spaces run **every Wednesday at 5PM PT / 8PM ET**—join from the [Spaces landing page](/spaces/).
